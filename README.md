# Got
Like Git, but with an 'o'

Got is version control, with a model similar to Git's.
A solution to the problems that come from using Git to store all of your data.
Got uses an improved data structure that better handles large files and directories, and encrypts all the data that you give it.

## Features/Roadmap
- [x] Content-Defined chunking of large files into blobs with a maximum size.
- [x] E2E encryption. Branch names, directory names, file names, and file sizes can all be hidden from remote repositories.
- [x] Efficiently add/remove large files and directories to/from existing filesystems.
- [x] Stage changes with `add`, `rm`, `put`, and `discard` commands.
- [x] Inspect branch state with `cat` and `ls`.
- [x] Print and change the active branch with `active` command.
- [x] Commit changes, with `commit`.
- [x] Create, delete, and list branches with `branch` commands.
- [x] Copy one branch state to another with `sync`.
- [x] Share repositories using the [Blobcache protocol](https://github.com/blobcache/blobcache) with `serve` command.
- [x] Efficiently pack many small files into fewer blobs.
- [ ] Checkout the head of a branch to the working directory.
- [ ] Merge 2 branches.

## Getting Started
Either download a prebuilt binary or build one from source.

Then initialize a repository in the current working directory.
Make sure you `cd` to where you want the repository.
```shell
$ got init
```

## Contributing
We use `just` as a command runner.
All of the common development tasks have `just` commands.

To run the tests:
```shell
$ just test
```

Installs to `$GOPATH/bin` with just.
If that isn't on your path, just copy the executable from there to wherever you want.

```shell
$ just install
```

To build release binaries
```shell
TAG=v0.0.x just build
```
Where `TAG` is an environment variable which should be set to the release version, or the Git hash of the source used for the build.
The release binaries will be under the `out` directory.

## Got in Action
Got importing a 3GB file.
```shell
$ got add large_file.dat
