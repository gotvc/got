# Got
Like Git, but with an 'o'

Got is version control, with a model similar to Git's, extending ideas from [WebFS](https://github.com/brendoncarroll/webfs).

Got uses [INET256](https://github.com/inet256/inet256) to easily and securely connect repositories.

## Features
- Snapshot based version control.
- Good support for large files
- Data is end to end encrypted.
- Multi-Backend, using [Cells](./pkg/cells) and [Stores](./pkg/stores)

## Getting Started
Installs to `$GOPATH/bin` with make.
If that isn't on your path, just copy the executable from there to whereever you want.

```shell
$ make install
```

Then initialize a repository in the current working directory.
Make sure you `cd` to where you want the repository.
```shell
$ got init
```

## Contributing
To run the tests:
```shell
$ make test
```
