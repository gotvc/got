# Concepts

This sections explains concepts in Got is greater detail.
There is little discussion of how any of these concepts are implemented.
The focus is on explaining the model to users, so they can reason about what Got is doing, and what parts they need to use to do what they want.

These sections are organized zoomed-out -> zoomed-in.
Some people may prefer to read these sections in reverse.
The main goal when using Got is to get data into a Filesystem, and then mangage versions of Filesystems using Snapshots.
Those concepts are in the last sections.
The first sections are things that manage configuration or resources to facillitate use of the concepts in later sections.
