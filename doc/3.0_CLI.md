# CLI Reference

```
got

got is like git, but with an 'o'

REPO:
  iden   manage identities
  init   initializes a repository in the current directory
  scrub  runs integrity checks
  serve  serves the local space over Blobcache Protocol (BCP)

WORKING COPY & STAGING:
  add       adds paths to the staging area
  checkout  switches HEAD to the specified mark and then performs an export
  clear     clears the staging area
  commit    applies the contents of staging to the HEAD mark, updating it to the new snapshot
  discard   discards any changes staged for a path
  fork      creates a new mark pointed at the target of the current mark
  head      prints or sets HEAD.  HEAD is the name of a mark in the local Space
  put       stages paths for replacement
  rm        stages paths for deletion
  status    shows the status of the working tree
  wc        commands for managing working copies

MARKS:
  cat      writes the contents of path in the current volume to stdout
  history  prints the snapshot log
  ls       lists the children of path in the current volume
  mark     manage the marks in a space and what they point at

SPACES:
  fetch  fetches marks from spaces according to the config
  push   distributes marks to spaces according to the config
  space  manage namespaces

ADAPTERS:
  ftp   serve files over FTP
  http  serve files over HTTP

MISCELLANEOUS:
  bc       manage blobcache
  version  prints version information
```

## Most Common

### `got init`
Initializes a Got repo in the current working directory.

## Repositories

### `got space`
Manages the spaces configured by the Repo.

### `got iden`
List and manages identities.

### `got scrub`
Runs validation checks on the snapshots in the current history and their filesystems.

## Working Copy & Stage

### `got wc`
All Working Copy operations.

### `got status`
Prints information about the working copy, staging area, and untracked paths.

### `got add <path>`
Add the files at or below path to the staging area.

### `got put <path>`
Add the file or directory to the staging area.
`put` on a file is that same as `add`.
`put` on a directory will also delete any files not in the directory.

### `got rm <path>`
Mark the file for deletion in the staging area.
 
### `got discard <path>`
Discard any staged operations for this path.

### `got clear`
Untracks everything.

### `got clobber <path>`
Overwrites the data in the working tree at path with whatever is in the active branch

### `got commit [-m <message>]`
Creates a new [Snapshot](./2.5_Snapshots.md) by applying any changes in the staging area to the current branch.
The current branch's head is updated to the new snapshot.

### `got head [name]`

If `name` is provided, changes HEAD to the provided name.  If no name is provided, it prints HEAD.

## Bookmarks

### [`got mark`](./3.2_got_wc.md)
Manage marks

### `got history`
Prints the active branch Snapshot chain starting with the branch head.
Similar to `git log`.

### `got fork <name>`
1. Creates a new branch called name, or errors if it exists.
2. Syncs the active branch to the new branch.
3. Sets the new branch as the active branch.

> This command is how history splits.  It is analagous to `git checkout -b <name>`

### `got sync <src> <dst>`
Sync the contents of mark `<src>` to a mark `<dst>`.

## Filesystem

### `got ls <path>`
Lists the children of path in the filesystem contained in the current Snapshot.

### `got cat <path>`
Writes the contents of the file at path, from the filesystem contained in the current Snapshot, to stdout.

## Misc

### `got version`
Prints version information, including information about which tools where used to build Got.
