# Introduction to Got

Got is Version Control, with a model similar to Git's.
Unlike Git, it works well with files and directories of any size, and end-to-end encrypts all the data that you give it.

If you are new to Got checkout some of the introductions in this section.
Then take a look at the [Concepts](./2.0_Concepts.md) section to get a deeper understanding.
