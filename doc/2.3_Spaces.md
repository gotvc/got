# Spaces

Each [Repo](./2.1_Repo.md) manages a set of named spaces.
The Repo always has one local Space, which has the empty string for a name.
The local Space is implicitly where marks are queried for unless a Space is explicitly provided.

Spaces can be managed using the `got space` command.
Spaces are configured in the `.got/config` file.

## GotNS
Spaces are represented using a format called GotNS.
It maps keys (string names for Marks) to values (a Snapshot and Mark metadata).
A Space is stored in its own Volume, and Space Volumes always have their roots encrypted.
GotNS uses the same GotKV format as GotFS and similarly inherits encryption of all the data in the Volumes's store.

## Syncing
Syncing can be perfored between any two Spaces.
The `push` and `fetch` operations perform Sync tasks on two Spaces.
For push the destiation is some remote Space, and the source is the local Space.
For fetch, it is the opposite; the destination is assumed to be the local Space, and the source is some remote Space.
