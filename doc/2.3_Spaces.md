# Spaces

Each [Repo](./2.1_Repo.md) manages a set of named spaces.
The Repo always has one local Space, which has the empty string for a name.
The local Space is implicitly where marks are queried for unless a Space is explicitly provided.

Spaces can be managed using the `got space` command.
Spaces are configured in the `.got/config` file.

## Syncing
Syncing can be perfored between any two Spaces.
