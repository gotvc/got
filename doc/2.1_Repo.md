# Repositories

A Repository (Repo for short) is the top level object in Got.
There can be 1 instance of the application running per Repo.

A Repo requires the following resources
- A directory in the local filesystem
- Access to a Volume in the Blobcache service

Repo's manage storage for all the data in Got.
Repo configuration is stored in the filesystem directory.
Cryptographic private keys are also stored in the filesystem.
Blobcache (a storage service) is used to hold all the file content.
Got can be configured to use the system's Blobcache, or it can self-host a Blobcache instance in-process.

A Got directory is considered a Repo if it contains a subdirectory `.got` and the regular file `.got/config` exists and contains a valid Got configuration.

The Got command line tool assumes that the process's current directory is a Repo or [Working Copy](./2.2_Working_Copy.md).
