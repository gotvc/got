# Working Copy

A Working Copy (WC for short) is a directory in the filesystem which contains a `.got` subdirectory where the regular file `.got/wc-config` exists and contains a valid Got Working Copy configuration.

The WC manages importing/exporting data to/from Got.
As a principal, Got only deletes or changes data, which it knows about.
If a file was exported by Got, or has been imported to Got, then it is known.
If it has been changed since Got last exported to the path, or it has yet to be imported into Got, then it is unknown.

Each WC requires:
- Access to the directory in the filesystem.
- Access to a Repository.

Many WCs can share a single Repo.
One WC usually shares a directory with a Repo.
Although the two would not share any configuration or data files.

## Stage
Each WC controls one of the Repo's Stages.
The working copy uses a Stage to stage changes to the current committed filesystem.

The stage holds operations on non-overlapping prefixes.
Each prefix can hold a single operation, one of:
- `CREATE` creates a new file
- `MDATA`  modifies an existing file's content
- `MMODE`  modifies the file's mode
- `MATTR`  modifies a file attribute
- `DELETE` removes a file or directory
Prefixes must correspond to a file or directory.
