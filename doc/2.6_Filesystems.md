# Filesystems

Got tracks all files using a persistent copy-on-write filesystem on top of content-addressed storage.
This system is called GotFS.

GotFS instances are the unit of data in Got.
They are the objects that are being versioned.

## Root
A GotFS filesystem is defined by its root.
The root contains the information needed to retrieve all of the data for that filesystem.
A root is 65 bytes long; 32 of those bytes is a hash, another 32 is an encryption key.
The last extra byte is something like the logarithm of the number of files.

## Infos
GotFS tracks a small amount of per path metadata in addition to the contents of files.
This metadata includes the file's mode, and attributes as key-value pairs.

## Chunking and Packing


## Technical Details
Take a look at the [README](../src/gotfs/README.md) in the [GotKV](../src/gotfs) package for more details.
